              <h2>1. Collection of Information</h2>
              <h3>(a) Active Collection and Use of Personal Information</h3>
              <p>
                The Company collects and saves your personal information (“Personal Information”) that you enter on the Site. Personal Information includes, but is not limited to, your first and last name, date of birth, street address, city, state, zip code, email address, and telephone number. It also includes any comments, suggestions, or other information you provide relating to the Site, the Company’s products, or the Company.
              </p>
              <h3>(b) Passive Collection of Information through Tracking Technology</h3>
              <p>
                The Site uses Google Analytics, a web analytics service provided by Google, Inc. ("Google") to help analyze how users use the Site. Google Analytics uses “cookies” and other tracking technology to collect aggregate data (“Aggregate Data”) from your visits to the Site. Cookies are text files the Site places in your computer’s browser to store your preferences. Cookies do not cause damage to your computer system or files. Only the website that transferred a particular cookie to you can read, modify, or delete such cookie. Your browser should allow you to delete existing cookies, decline cookies, or give you the choice of declining or accepting cookies. Your Personal Information will not be extracted from the cookies. To learn more about the privacy policy of Google Analytics, refer to <a href="https://www.google.com/policies/">Google's Policies and Principles</a>. Use the <a href="https://tools.google.com/dlpage/gaoptout?hl=en">Google Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on</a> to prevent analytics information from being sent to Google Analytics. The Company stores any Aggregate Data we collect from you in aggregate form. The Company is not able to identify any particular user or individual from the Aggregate Data. The Company uses the Aggregate Data it collects in a variety of ways, including but not limited to keeping count of your return visits to the Site, accumulating and reporting aggregate statistical information regarding the Site, and determining which features users prefer.<br><br>

                The Site may also use “pixel tags,” “web beacons,” “clear GIFs,” or similar means (collectively, “Pixel Tags”) to compile aggregate statistics about Site usage and response rates. Pixel Tags allow the Company to count the number of users who have visited certain pages of the Site, to deliver branded services, and to help the Company determine the effectiveness of its promotional or advertising campaigns as well as the effectiveness of the Site itself. When Pixel Tags are used in HTML-formatted email messages, they can tell the sender whether and when the email has been opened.<br><br>

                The Site collects referrers (information your web browser passes to the Company’s web server that references the URL which you used to access the Site) and your Internet Protocol (IP) address (the number used by computers on the network to identify your computer so that you can receive data). The Site also collects other environmental variables. Environmental variables include, but are not limited to, the domain from which you access the Internet, the time you accessed the Site, the type of web browser, operating system, and platform your computer uses, the Internet address of the previous website you visited before entering the Site, the names of the pages you visit while at the Site, and the next Internet website you visit after leaving the Site.

              </p>
              <h3>(b) Service Providers.</h3>
              <p>
                From time to time, we may employ companies and individuals to perform certain services on our behalf (such as advertising and marketing, consulting, legal, or other services). These third-party service providers may have access to your information, but only to the extent required to perform their assigned roles, and they may not use your information for any other reason.
              </p>
              <h3>(c) Business Transactions.</h3>
              <p>
                The Company reserves the right to transfer any information collected, including Personal Information, in the event of a transfer of ownership, assets, securities, or bankruptcy involving the Company and in connection with Company business transactions such as buying or selling subsidiaries or engaging in joint ventures with third parties; provided, however, the Company will use reasonable efforts to direct the transferee to use any transferred information, including Personal Information, in a manner that is consistent with this Privacy Policy.
              </p>
              <h3>(d) Compliance with Law.</h3>
              <p>
                We may release Personal Information about you if we believe such a release is necessary to comply with the law or in response to a subpoena or other legal process. The Company also reserves the right to collect and share any information the Company deems necessary to investigate or take action in connection with suspected fraud, illegal activities, possible harm to persons or property, or as otherwise required or permitted by the law.

              <h2>3. Disclosure</h2>
              <h3>(a) Accuracy and Confidentiality</h3>
              <p>
                It is your responsibility to enter current, complete, truthful, and accurate information, and to keep such information up to date. The Company cannot and will not be responsible for any liability or other problems that may arise from your failure to enter accurate, truthful, or complete information, or your failure to update such information. You are solely responsible for maintaining the strict confidentiality of your Login Information, if applicable, and for any charges, costs, expenses, damages, liabilities, and losses the Company may suffer as a result of your failure to do so. You, not the Company, are solely responsible and liable for your activity, behavior, use, and conduct on the Site or any other activity or conduct in connection with the Site. Any submission of information, by you does not guarantee that the Company will permit you to use any or all of the features or functions of the Site.
              </p>
              <h3>(b) Communication with Users; Opt-Outs</h3>
              <p>
                The Company may contact users who have entered Personal Information in connection with the Site. You may “opt out” of receiving marketing and promotional emails by following the opt-out procedure described in each email the Company sends. However, even if you opt out of receiving marketing and promotional emails, the Company may continue to email you for administrative or informational purposes, including follow-up messages regarding any content you have submitted to the Site.<br><br>

                The Company does not and will not send you emails asking you to provide or confirm sensitive Personal Information. A technique known as “phishing” attempts to steal personal identity data and financial account credentials from consumers. “Phishers” use “spoofed” emails to lead consumers to sham websites which trick recipients into divulging Personal Information including credit card numbers, account usernames, passwords, and social security numbers. If you receive such an email communication purporting to be from DrinkLikeABoss.com, please forward it immediately to <a href="mailto:info@stoutbeverages.com">info@stoutbeverages.com</a> and then delete it from your computer.
